# weather-project
This a weather forcast app.It has a search input and user by typing in it can find weather forcast of diffrent cities.
I used  html5, css3 and js to implement diffrent functionality, such as fetching the data and search logic.
For implemnting the design I used modern css such as css variables and flex.

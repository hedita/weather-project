# weather-project
This is a weather forecast app. It features a search input that allows users to find weather forecasts for different cities. I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to implement various functionalities, including data fetching and search logic. To design the app, I utilized modern CSS techniques like CSS variables and flexbox.
